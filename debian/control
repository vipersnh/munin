Description: network-wide graphing framework (node)
 This package contains the daemon for the nodes being monitored. You
 should install it on all the nodes in your network. It will know how
 to extract all sorts of data from the node it runs on, and will wait
 for the gatherer to request this data for further processing.
 .
 Munin is a highly flexible and powerful solution used to create
 graphs of virtually everything imaginable throughout your network,
 while still maintaining a rattling ease of installation and
 configuration.
 .
 Munin is written in Perl, and relies heavily on Tobi Oetiker's
 excellent RRDtool. To see a real example of Munin in action, you can
 follow a link from <http://munin-monitoring.org/> to a live
 installation.

Description: network-wide graphing framework (grapher/gatherer)
 Munin is a highly flexible and powerful solution used to create
 graphs of virtually everything imaginable throughout your network,
 while still maintaining a rattling ease of installation and
 configuration.
 .
 This package contains the grapher/gatherer. You will only need one
 instance of it in your network. It will periodically poll all the
 nodes in your network it's aware of for data, and serves the result
 in a built-in http server, suitable for viewing with your web browser
 of choice.
 .
 It is also able to alert you if any value is outside of a preset
 boundary, useful if you want to be alerted if a filesystem is about
 to grow full, for instance.  You can do this by making Munin run an
 arbitrary command when you need to be alert it, or make use of the
 intrinsic Nagios support.
 .
 Munin is written in Perl, and relies heavily on Tobi Oetiker's
 excellent RRDtool. To see a real example of Munin in action, you can
 follow a link from <http://munin-monitoring.org/> to a live
 installation.
